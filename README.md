# GitHub Pages Site
This GitHub Pages site includes code to set up a basic resume site. It consists of a landing and a projects page, both with a nav bar. The landing page has a bio and intro video, along with links to my LinkedIn and Github and my email contact info. The projects page hightlights a few of my GitHub repos with links to the GitHub repos.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
In the future, the hope is to improve on this project with more dynamic and fine-tuned styling of the pages, as well as adding a background animation.
