                <p>My name is Mariah Villanueva and I am a software engineer currently 
                    living in Pittsburgh, PA. I have Bachelorâ€™s of Science degrees in Biomedical 
                    Engineering and Computer Science from Virginia Commonwealth University 
                    and the University of Pittsburgh respectively. I have an interest in a 
                    variety of computer science areas, including data analytics and cybersecurity, 
                    but my current passion and past experience is largely in web development. 
                    I have almost two years of experience as a backend web developer and DevOps 
                    support specialist, and am currently in the process of rounding out my web 
                    development skill set with a MERN Full Stack Development certification 
                    course offered by MITxPRO.
